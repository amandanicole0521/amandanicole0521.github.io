<h4> So who am I?</h4>
Hello my name is Amanda Gallegos and I am born and rasied in San Antonio, Tx.  I am 37 years old and have recently changed my career from a Branch Manager to a Business Analyst. 
<br/>
I am a mother to 3 kids, <b>Damian-17</b>, <b>Adriana-15</b> and <b>Ricky-7</b>.  I know a <b><i><u>BIG</u></i></b> age gap with my last kiddo but I have to say being older has given me more patience for him.
<p>In addition I also have 3 dogs! So I basically have a total of 8 mouths to feed.  My husband and I like to joke around that we are walking circus anytime we go into a store or restaurants; but I wouldn't have it anyother way</p>
<br/>My husband and I will be celebrating <i>13</i> years married on February 2nd and I am super excited to finally be taking a trip to <i>Napa, California</i>; wine country to taste the <b>BEST</b> wine ever!
<p>About 10 years ago my husband and I lost over 40 pounds and are on this health kick. Zoes Kitchen is my favorite place to eat! 
<br/>

Not only did we start eating right but we have ran over fifteen half marathons and yes we are werid but we love running! We followed a simple running plan and if you want more information please feel free to reach out.
